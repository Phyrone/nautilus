                          Folia is a fork of Paper with regionized multithreading. WARNING: all plugins need to have explicit support for Folia to work. Folia makes most sense for large servers with many spread out players. Find more information at [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/software/folia).

                          Purpur is a fork of Paper (more exact Pufferfish) with additional features and optimizations. Most significantly, it makes a lot more mechanics configurable. It also add some nice commands like (/tpsbar, /rambar and more).

                      These are the resource ids inside spigotmc. They will be automatically placed in the plugins folder. Not all resources are downloadable as some are premium or point to external sites which might not be supported. The resource id is part of the url of the resource. f.e. `https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/luckperms.28140/` has the id `28140`.

                      See more at [Itzg's Minecraft Docker Image](https://docker-minecraft-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mods-and-plugins/spiget/) We might extract the resource id from the url ourselves in the future.
